	* An extension to the penalty shootout question - what's the probability of winning overall? [python script](Penalties.py)
	* A presentation I made for one of the PhD reading groups at LSE introducing Bayesian estimation and applying it to Bayesian Hierarchical models - a tool to evaluate internal vs external validity (how far studies generalise to other situations) [here](Bayes_Hierarchical_Models_etc.pdf)
* **Class 2:** tba
* **Class 3:** tba
* **Class 4:** tba
