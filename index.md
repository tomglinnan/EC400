# EC400 Class Resources

This page is a list of notes I wrote teaching my online classes for EC400 Probability and Statistics in September 2021

Please email me if you have any questions!

* **Class 1 - Foundations:** cdfs, pdfs, problem solving ideas, and why you should care about probability: [here](Class 1.pdf)
	* An extension to the penalty shootout question - what's the probability of winning overall? [python script](Penalties.py)
	* A presentation I made for one of the PhD reading groups at LSE introducing Bayesian estimation and applying it to Bayesian Hierarchical models - a tool to evaluate internal vs external validity (how far studies generalise to other situations) [here](Bayes_Hierarchical_Models_etc.pdf)
* **Class 2 - Conditionals and Marginals:** Double integrals, the importance of drawing diagrams, and slices of mountains [here](Class 2.pdf)
* **Class 3 - Change of Variables for pdfs:** How it's really integration by substitution, plus a quick tutorial on multivariate integrals [here](Class 3.pdf)
* **Class 4 - Estimation:** Solving MLE in (at least) 3 ways, don't just blindly take FOCs (!), the hierarchy of estimation, and how to think about 'doing' econometrics [here](Class 4.pdf)
* **Class 5:** tba
	* Some notes on estimation, hypothesis testing and how to do applied micro from a previous course I taught [here](Lightning_Research_Stats.pdf)
